Course Advising System Project Reflection

In this project, I developed a **course advising system** for ABC Universityâ€™s Computer Science department. The goal was to allow advisors to efficiently **load course data, display a sorted course list, and retrieve course prerequisites**. Choosing the right **data structure** was crucial, and after evaluating vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees, I selected a **hash table** for its fast lookup times, making it the most efficient option.

Throughout development, I faced challenges such as **compilation warnings, prerequisite validation, and file handling**. Debugging, careful testing, and refining my approach helped me resolve these issues. Adjusting my compilation settings to support **C++11 features** and ensuring proper prerequisite linking were key problem-solving steps.

This project reinforced the importance of **planning before coding**, especially through **pseudocode** and structured design. It also helped me improve how I write **maintainable, readable, and adaptable code** by focusing on **function modularity, clear variable naming, and error handling**. Overall, this experience strengthened my ability to design efficient software solutions and approach problem-solving with a structured mindset.
